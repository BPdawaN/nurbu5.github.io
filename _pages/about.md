Hi my name is Dawa Nurbu Sherpa. I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal, and my family moved overseas when I was three. On the weekends
I like to hike and play chess with my friends at the local coffee shop.

I'm a software developer currently located in Denver, Colorado. I haven't figured out what I'm going to do with this blog,
but I hope it turns out to be insightful and positive.
